      <h3>The Dave Roberts Steal (ALCS Game 4)</h3>
      <p>With the Red Sox trailing the Yankees 3-0 in the ALCS and down by a run in the 9th inning, Dave Roberts came in as a pinch-runner after Kevin Millar drew a walk. Everyone in the stadium knew Roberts would try to steal second base—and he did it successfully. That steal set up Bill Mueller’s game-tying single, sparking the Red Sox’s improbable comeback.</p>

      <h3>Curt Schilling's Bloody Sock (ALCS Game 6)</h3>
      <p>Pitching with a torn tendon in his right ankle, Curt Schilling delivered a gutsy performance in Game 6 of the ALCS against the Yankees. The medical team had sutured his tendon to stabilize it, causing blood to seep through his sock during the game. Despite his injury, Schilling pitched 7 innings, allowing only 1 run and keeping the Red Sox’s comeback hopes alive.</p>

      <h3>Keith Foulke's Final Out (World Series Game 4)</h3>
      <p>In the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 4, closer Keith Foulke fielded a weak grounder from Edgar Rentería and tossed it to first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz for the final out. The Red Sox won 3-0, completing the sweep of the Cardinals and securing their first World Series title since 1918.
Each of these moments played a crucial role in one of baseball’s greatest comebacks and the ultimate breaking of the "Curse of the Bambino."

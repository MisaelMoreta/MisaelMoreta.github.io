The 2004 Boston Red Sox pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in sports history to capture their first World Series title in 86 years, breaking the "Curse of the Bambino." Down 3-0 in the ALCS against their fierce rivals, the New York Yankees, the Sox seemed destined for another heartbreaking season. But then came Game 4, when Dave Roberts' iconic stolen base in the 9th inning—one of the most clutch plays in baseball—set the stage for a game-tying hit by Bill Mueller. That moment sparked life into the team. David Ortiz, "Big Papi," was unstoppable, delivering walk-off hits in Games 4 and 5, solidifying his legendary status in Boston lore. The pitching staff, led by Curt Schilling's unforgettable "bloody sock" performance in Game 6, shut down the Yankees’ bats, completing the first-ever 3-0 series comeback in MLB history.

When they reached the World Series, the Red Sox made quick work of the St. Louis Cardinals, sweeping them in four games. Manny Ramirez, who was an offensive juggernaut throughout the playoffs, earned World Series MVP honors. Every piece fell into place—from Johnny Damon’s leadoff heroics to the dominant bullpen led by Keith Foulke. That final out, with Foulke tossing the ball to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base, was the exclamation point on a team of destiny that finally shattered decades of frustration for Red Sox fans.
